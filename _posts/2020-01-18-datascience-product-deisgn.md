How do we design a product? What thinking needs to go behind a product?

# Product Design

Product Design is directly inline with Customer Success. Data science and engineering are tools to design a great product.

A good product has following requirement

* Easy to use
* Fullfil a specific client's need
* Minimal features that serve the purpose
* looks appealing in a visual sense
* Works consistently
* Biggest differentiator or a stand out in the market
* Not easy to replicate


## How do we shape a product?

1. Does it solve a customer's pain point?

Recent example is when I went to puchase living room carpets at a local market in Bangalore, I was asked to pay in cash to avoid incurring credit/debit fees. Please note, there is a [limit](https://taxguru.in/income-tax/rs-2-lakh-cash-transaction-limit-wef-01apr2017-details-examples.html) on the cash transaction in India. It benefits both the merchant and the buyer to avoid transaction fees, if the amounts are small.  Can we solve this problem? A new fintech maybe with lower transaction fees or waived off fully.

Data science and engineering teams can help identify the ideal transaction fees or risk-reward profiles to choose for offering to customers who want to make purchase through new systems

2. What features can be built to the product?

Product may require just to fulfil one function, in that case we have to be pick and choose features that work well every time

3. Defining the quality of the product?

Product scope must be well-defined and the product must yield expected and consistent results. 

4. What should be the life of the product?



# Data science and Product Management

Earlier approaches of decision making inside a product was drive primarily by a rule-based system or a fuzzy-logic sytem. This has been replaced with decision making by purely a data-driven approach. The products will continue to evolve into learning based systems, with reinforcement lerning algorithms and other AI techniques powering the product.



## Competition

Following are critical decisions

1. Who is going to be my customer?
2. What do I offer to my customer that no other competitor can provide right now?
3. Are most of the features being used by my customer?



# Way forward

Product management is at its core a multi-tasking job. A clear set of priorities by the day, week, month annd quarterly is essential to succeed.
