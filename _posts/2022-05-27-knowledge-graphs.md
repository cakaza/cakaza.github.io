Create large relational graph databases between entities (User, Product, Places etc )

We can store the data in a relational database for storing or retrieving faster, answer the queries seamlessly on complex questions

Who buys the Audi car from an NJ Showroom? Where do they live? what is their demographics and what is their income? Can we find similar people in their neighborhood? or their close relatives, friends, colleaques and acquaintances
