<p>How do we design a product? What thinking needs to go behind a product?</p>

<h1 id="product-design">Product Design</h1>

<p>Product Design is directly inline with Customer Success. Data science and engineering are tools to design a great product.</p>

<p>A good product has following requirement</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy to use</li>
  <li>Fullfil a specific client’s need</li>
  <li>Minimal features that serve the purpose</li>
  <li>looks appealing in a visual sense</li>
  <li>Works consistently</li>
  <li>Biggest differentiator or a stand out in the market</li>
  <li>Not easy to replicate</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-we-shape-a-product">How do we shape a product?</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Does it solve a customer’s pain point?</li>
</ol>

<p>Recent example is when I went to puchase living room carpets at a local market in Bangalore, I was asked to pay in cash to avoid incurring credit/debit fees. Please note, there is a <a href="https://taxguru.in/income-tax/rs-2-lakh-cash-transaction-limit-wef-01apr2017-details-examples.html">limit</a> on the cash transaction in India. It benefits both the merchant and the buyer to avoid transaction fees, if the amounts are small.  Can we solve this problem? A new fintech maybe with lower transaction fees or waived off fully.</p>

<p>Data science and engineering teams can help identify the ideal transaction fees or risk-reward profiles to choose for offering to customers who want to make purchase through new systems</p>

<ol>
  <li>What features can be built to the product?</li>
</ol>

<p>Product may require just to fulfil one function, in that case we have to be pick and choose features that work well every time</p>

<ol>
  <li>Defining the quality of the product?</li>
</ol>

<p>Product scope must be well-defined and the product must yield expected and consistent results.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What should be the life of the product?</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="data-science-and-product-management">Data science and Product Management</h1>

<p>Earlier approaches of decision making inside a product was drive primarily by a rule-based system or a fuzzy-logic sytem. This has been replaced with decision making by purely a data-driven approach. The products will continue to evolve into learning based systems, with reinforcement lerning algorithms and other AI techniques powering the product.</p>

<h2 id="competition">Competition</h2>

<p>Following are critical decisions</p>

<ol>
  <li>Who is going to be my customer?</li>
  <li>What do I offer to my customer that no other competitor can provide right now?</li>
  <li>Are most of the features being used by my customer?</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="way-forward">Way forward</h1>

<p>Product management is at its core a multi-tasking job. A clear set of priorities by the day, week, month annd quarterly is essential to succeed.</p>
